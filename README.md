# ResponsiveEmailTemplateGen
A little webapp to build responsive emails using JS. Also, an excuse to learn JS.

It's a work in progress, bear with me. Yeah, it doesn't do what it says it does yet. 
Don't expect an apology, I'm just getting around to learning this stuff.

None of this would've happened if someone else had done it first. As far as I know, no one has.

Design Goals:
Produce a template file for responsive email
  Based off a drag-and-drop interface
  Tiles represent code blocks
  
Overly Ambitious goals:
  Ability to include text boxes and image links
  Dynamic generation of text input boxes
  Ability to re-order tiles
  Export to downloadable text file

Extra-super-overly ambitious goals:
  Live preview below the fold
  
  So far, I'm feeling pretty good about it. I've got drag-and-drop working, unique ID generation, copying, deleting, and making sure all elements are present on the page.
  It's just everything else that needs to be added in.
