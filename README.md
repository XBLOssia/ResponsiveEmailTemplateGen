# ResponsiveEmailTemplateGen
A little webapp to build responsive emails using JS. Also, an excuse to learn JS.

It's a work in progress, bear with me. Yeah, it doesn't do what it says it does yet. <br />
Don't expect an apology, I'm just getting around to learning this stuff.

None of this would've happened if someone else had done it first. As far as I know, no one has.

Design Goals:
Produce a template file for responsive email<br />
  Based off a drag-and-drop interface<br />
  Tiles represent code blocks<p>
  
<s>Overly Ambitious goals:
  Ability to include text boxes and image links<br />
  Dynamic generation of text input boxes<br />
  Ability to re-order tiles<br />
  Export to downloadable text file<br /></s> Yeah, I did all that, more or less. I could do it better, but it's good enough now for me to be satisfied with at least that much.

<p>Extra-super-overly ambitious goals:<br />

Eventually I'll make it so you can select your bgcolor, header img (200x50), and your own signature image.
