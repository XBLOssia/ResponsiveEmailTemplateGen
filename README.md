# ResponsiveEmailTemplateGen
<p>A little webapp to build responsive emails using JS. Also, an excuse to learn JS.

<p>It's a little jank, and I'm not entirely done with everything I want to do with it yet. <br />
Don't expect an apology, I'm just getting around to learning this stuff.

<p>None of this would've happened if someone else had done it first. As far as I know, no one has.

<p>To use: Drag a block from the left box to the right box, then click the "update" button. Best results if the header and closer are at the top and bottom, respectively. I should really go back and make those static, and maybe I will eventually.

<p>After you hit the button, put the appropriate stuff in the appropriate boxes. Yes, you can mess with the formatting of text in those editors. Yes, I audibly said "Oh, no." when I saw that you could use Comic Sans, and it'll work. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

<p>Once you've got all your stuff in, push the download button to receive <s>bacon</s> your output.html file. Open this in a browser, make sure it's working, then copy and paste the text into Thunderbird and send that sucker off to your mailing list of choice.

<p>Done:
Produce a template file for responsive email<br />
  Based off a drag-and-drop interface<br />
  Tiles represent code blocks<p>
  Ability to include text boxes and image links<br />
  Dynamic generation of text input boxes<br />
  Ability to re-order tiles<br />
  Export to downloadable html file<br />
  Yeah, I did all that, more or less. I could do it better, but it's good enough now for me to be satisfied with at least that much.

<p>Extra-super-overly ambitious goals:<br />
  Live preview below the fold

Eventually I'll make it so you can select your bgcolor, header img (200x50), and your own signature image.
